# Electric-Vehicle-Population-
This project explores the electric vehicle population in Washington, USA

The purpose of this project is to improve:
  1. Knowledge in Data Cleaning, Transforming Data, and Joins
  2. Creating Visualizations using Tableau
  3. Making meaningful conclusions

I am interested in this particular subject because I would like to see how data could help companies, specifically automotive companies, anticipate where their best customers are located.

Steps:

  1. Determine questions:
    a) What is the most popular model being purchased? What is the average cost of the vehicle? What is the average mileage of the car? 
    b) Where are these popular models being purchased? (Further analysis would be to investigate the area's economy to determine a reason why EV's are populated there.)
    c) Are customers buying newer models or older ones? What is the difference in mileage for the models?

  2. Clean Data to accomodate the questions
  3. Create Visualizations
  4. Answer Questions
